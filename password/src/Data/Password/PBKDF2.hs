= PBKDF2

The PBKDF2 algorithm is one of the oldest and most solid password
algorithms out there. It has also, however, been shown to be
the least secure out of all major password algorithms. The main
reason for this is that is doesn't make use of any memory cost
or other method of making it difficult for specialized hardware
attacks, like GPU cracking attacks.

It is still, however used all over the world, since it has been
shown to be a very reliable way to encrypt passwords. Though it is
most definitely better than trying to develop a password algorithm
on your own, or god-forbid, not using /any/ encryption on your stored
passwords.

== Other algorithms

Seeing as PBKDF2 is shown to be very weak in terms of protection
against GPU cracking attacks, it is generally advised to go with
@"Bcrypt"@, if not @"Scrypt"@ or @"Argon2"@. When unsure, @"Bcrypt"@
would probably be the safest option, as it has no memory cost which
could become a problem if not properly calibrated to the machine
doing the password verifications.
