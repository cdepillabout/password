This library provides functions for working with passwords and password hashes in Haskell.

Currently supports the following algorithms:

* `PBKDF2`
* `bcrypt`
* `scrypt`
* `Argon2`

Also, see the [password-instances](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances)
package for instances for common typeclasses.
